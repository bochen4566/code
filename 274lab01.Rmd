```{r}
X <- runif(1000, min = -1, max = 1)
Y <- X^2
colre <- mean(X*Y)-mean(X)*mean(Y)
colre
#the colrelation is near 0 so it is unrelated
#Y is dependent on X 
#it might be dependent on X and Y's formation
```

# it is getting closer to the true mean as the sample size increases
# the larger the sample size the closer it is to the true mean
